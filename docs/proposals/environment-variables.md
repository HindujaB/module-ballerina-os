## Summary
At the moment, the Ballerina OS module only has APIs to retrieve environment variable information. However, itâ€™s not possible to perform other operations such as setting new environment variables, listing them, and unsettling particular environment variables. In this proposal, we describe how these requirements can be fascilitated.

## Goals
To support setting, unsettling, and listing environment variables.

## Motivation
To allow users to manipulate environment variables programmatically.

## Description
- The `setEnv` function can be used to set any environment variable programmatically.

```ballerina
# Sets the value of the environment variable named by the key. 
# ```ballerina
# os:Error err = os:setEnv("BALCONFIGFILE", "/path/to/Config.toml");
# ```
#
# + key - Key of the environment variable
# + value - Value of the environment variable
# + return - error if setting the environment variable fails
public isolated function setEnv(string key, string value) returns Error;
```

- Users can remove any particular environment variable from the system using the `unsetEnv` function.

```ballerina
# Removes a single environment variable from the system if it exists.
# ```ballerina
# var env = os:unsetEnv("BALCONFIGFILE");
# ```
#
# + name - Name of the environment variable
public isolated function unsetEnv(string key);
```

- To list the existing environment variables of the system, the `listEnv` function can be used. This would return the environment variables as a map.

```ballerina
# Returns a map of environment variables.
# ```ballerina
# map<string> envs = os:listEnv();
# ```
#
# + return - map of environment variables
public isolated function listEnv() returns map<string>;
```

## Testing
- Set an environment variable using the `setEnv` function and validate if it was set correctly.
- Remove the previously created environment variable using the `unsetEnv` function can check whether it had been removed from the system correctly.
- Retrieve the list of environment variables by calling the `listEnv` function and check whether this returns a valid `map<string>`.
